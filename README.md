# EDFA-data-reading-scripts
The scripts necessary to read the data files containing input-output power spectral denisty relations of EDFA and optical systems

The data files are located here:
[1] M. P. Yankov and F. D. Ros, “Input-output power spectral densities
for three C-band EDFAs and four multi-span inline EDFAd fiber
optic systems of different lengths,” Tech. Univ. Denmark. Dataset
https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.13135754 (2020).

The data relates to the following publications:
[2] F. D. Ros, U. C. de Moura, and M. P. Yankov, “Machine learningbased
EDFA gain model generalizable to multiple physical devices,” in
accepted, European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC),
available https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05326, (2020).
[3] M. P. Yankov, U. C. de Moura, and F. D. Ros, “Power evolution prediction
and optimization in a multi-span system based on componentwise
system modeling,” in accepted, European Conference on Optical
Communications (ECOC), available https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05348,
(2020).


The datasets contains metadata, such as:
1) unique ID of PSD profile
2) unique ID of physical amplifier
3) Total input and output power recordings of each EDFA
4) unique ID of the multi-span system, indicating the order of the EDFAs, as well as the fiber span lengths

As well as PSDs readings from an OSA for the input PSD and the output PSD at the OSA wavelengths.
